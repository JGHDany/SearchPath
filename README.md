# SearchPath

This is example of a complex project where I make use of the folowing concepts:
  - Object Oriented Programming (defining classes, contructors, methods, atributes). The files are separate by headers and source. 
  - TAD (queue, vector, map, stack, others)
  - Sort and search algorithms 
  - Algorithm to find shortest path in a weighted graph (dijkstra and bfs)
  - Use of File I/O
This project read a graph from a file (I manually generate this example, I have a picture of it graph.jpg) and using dijkstra and bfs algorithm to determine the best path acording with a user choice (cost, time or Distance). Note for this example source and destination need to be between 1 and 17.
