# SearchPath

This is example how to build complex projects where we have to make use of OOP, and separate headers from source files.
This project read a graph from a file (I manually generate this example, I have a picture of it graph.jpg) 
and using dijkstra and bfs algorithm to determine the best path acording with a user choice (cost, time or Distance) 
Note for this example source and destination need to be between 1 and 17.
